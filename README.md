### To install

If you want the Push Notifications to work you will need to create a Google Firebase Project to get you server key and GCM sender id. You can follow the tutorial here : [https://www.made-on-mars.com/blog/how-to-pwa#reengageable](https://www.made-on-mars.com/blog/how-to-pwa-an-introduction-on-progressive-web-app-and-a-tutorial-to-create-one-with-full-features-push-notification-service-worker-offline-mode/#reengageable)
